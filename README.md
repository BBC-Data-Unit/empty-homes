In November 2017 the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-41968461) London's commuter belt had seen a spike in the number of homes left long-term empty despite a downward trend across the UK since 2010.

The England figures from the Department for Communities and Local Government included those which had been unoccupied and substantially unfurnished for over six months but excluded second homes.

The unit also sourced and analysed figures on vacant homes from the National Records of Scotland, Data Unit Wales and Northern Irelandâ€™s Land & Property Services to produce UK-wide findings.

The Shared Data Unit makes data journalism available to news organisations across the media industry, as part of a partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association. Stories generated by the partnership included:
